## Introduction

This is a functional restaurant page for a fictional restaurant. Its purpose is to practice implementation of ES6 modules, using Webpack. I personally decided to use SASS as well so that i can practice a different CSS framework.

## Technologies

HTML, SASS and Javascript. Additional framework used is Webpack.

## Setup

To see the live page hosted by Github pages, click the link below:

## Project Status

The project is complete.

## Challenges Faced

Webpack turned out to be quite confusing. I mainly used the official documentation to set it up, but even with that, I think there are many important steps that I skipped. The only problem i encountered, thankfully, was some of my images not showing up on the live page. I fixed that by importing them into the js files. Still, my dist file is big, I think I skipped a bundling step somewhere, but at this point, I'm afraid to fix it as I tried to then lost my work.

I'll watch more videos to learn it better.

## Future Implementation

- Works as is. Perhaps add backend functionality to make email popup an email browser like gmail.
- Make the website load faster. Look into lazy load
